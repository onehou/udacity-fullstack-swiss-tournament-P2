# Swiss Tournament Round 1-2

This program will simulate the first two rounds of a Swiss Tournament. In the first round
each player will be randomly assigned to another and a win or loss will be recorded. In the second
round, those players who have one win will play one another and those with one loss will play one another.

###Verify that these files exist in the newly cloned repository:###<br>

	--tournament             #folder containing tournament files
	----tournament.py        #file that contains the python functions which unit tests will run on
	----tournament_test.py   #unit tests for tournament.py
	----tournament.sql       #postgresql database
	--Vagrantfile            #template that launches the Vagrant environment
	--pg_config.sh           #shell script provisioner called by Vagrantfile that performs
                              some configurations
